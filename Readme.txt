A mox is an organism occupying a cell in a cellular automaton. A mox has an orientation
and can sense landmarks in front of it. It also has a sense for the proximity of food.
A mox is capable of moving forward, turning, and consuming food.
A primary purpose of the project is investigate morphognosis learning and control of the mox.

Setup:

1. Unzip the moxworx.zip file.
2. Import Eclipse project.
3. Run .sh or .bat commands in the work directory.
